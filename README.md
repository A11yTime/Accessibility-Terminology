## Diverse Abilities and Barriers
### Blindness: The user of blindness relies on screen reader and keyboard to navigate application
#### Example of Barrier:
* Images, controls, and other structural elements that do not have equivalent text alternatives. 
* Video content that does not have text alternatives and missing control mechanisms.
* Missing keyboard access.
### Low vision: They can’t use application without proper color contrast and obvious visual focus indicator also rely on screen reader in some degree.
#### Example of Barrier:
* All barrier and challenge for blindness apply for low vision in addition,
* Text and images with insufficient contrast between foreground and background color combinations.
* Text, Images and page layout that cannot be resized, or that lose information when resized.

### Color blindness: They can’t distinguish between colors are most common is red and green and next most is blue and yellow.
2.	Physical disability: Physical disabilities include weakness and limitations of muscular control. They rely on keyboard, head pointer, mouth stick, voice recognition, eye tracking, slip-and-puff, Joystick, and name a few. All the assistive technology mentioned above mimic mouse and keyboard event. We are deficient in keyboard accessibility.
3.	Cognitive, Learning, and neurological disability: Cognitive, learning, and neurological disabilities involve neurodiversity and neurological disorders. They are distracted by blinking, flickering and flashing content. Any content that contains blinking, flickering and flashing content need to prove a mechanism to play and pause.

#### Keyboard: In essence we can say - All the interactive elements such as link, buttons form controls are functional with keyboard 
#### Focus Management: Focus management refers to setting focus properly to the appropriate elements to prevent user disorientation, frustration and leaving the site without buying product.
When keyboard only and screen users focus get lost with user interaction specially screen reader user it is difficult to make a guess what happen to the page and lead them leave the page with the decision page is not accessibility.
#### Accessible name: When screen reader user lands on elements without accessible name there is no way to them to understand what the UI is about. 
For example, when we provide an icon/icon link without alternative text or accessible name screen reader user completely unable to determine what it is for. Other examples .. slide .. we have 94203 as link name. It does make proper sense what it means though we have visual text for sighted user but it is not programmatically determined for screen reader user.
#### Heading level: Headings are used to define the section of page and screen reader user use it to understand the page content.
#### Heading hierarchy: heading should maintain hierarchical sequence to provide obvious sense of page sections.
#### Landmark: Lands are used to organize overall page structure and navigation. screen reader user uses it to bypass block of content effectively.
#### Error: Error is a crucial part of accessibility without programmatically determination of error and proper focus management form validation remain inaccessible for screen reader user.
